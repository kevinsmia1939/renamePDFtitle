Rename the PDF file to its title

This is addon for Dolphin file manager from KDE.

Rename the PDF file to its title.

Sometime, research papers from publisher are named weirdly, this rename the PDF file to the title of the paper.

This require exiftool to be installed.

exiftool read metadata with the tag: title which then is use to rename the file. If the PDF file does not have title tag, it would not work.
